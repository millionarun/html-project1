        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
        <p>              HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web 
            applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.Hyper Text: HyperText simply means 
            "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a
             new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
                   
            Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document.
             Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
            
            Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. 
            A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. 
            With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
            
            Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks
             in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content. </p>

        <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
        <p>❑ HTML is a standard defined by the WHATWG, an acronym for Web Hypertext
            Application Technology Working Group, an organization formed by people working
            on the most popular web browser. This means it's basically controlled by Google,
            Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft.
            ❑ In the past the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the organization in charge of
            creating the HTML standard.
            ❑ The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became clear that the
            W3C push towards XHTML was not a good idea.</p>

    <section id="Section3">
        <h2>HTML Versions</h2>
        <p>Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the HTML version is given <br>

            HTML 1.0: The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of HTML language, and it was released in1991. <br>
            
            HTML 2.0: This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was standard language version for website design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements such as text box, option button, etc. <br>
            
            HTML 3.2: HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported by most of the browsers. <br>
            
            HTML 4.01: HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very stable version of HTML language. This version is the current official standard, and it provides added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting ability for various multimedia elements. <br>
            
            HTML5 : HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first draft of this version was announced in January 2008. There are two major organizations one is W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and another one is WHATWG( Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) which are involved in the development of HTML 5 version, and still, it is under development.</p>

        <h2>HTML & Browsers</h2>
        <p>
            ❑ It can be generated by a server-side application that builds it depending on
            the request or the session data, for example, a Rails or Laravel, or Django
            application.
            ❑ It can be generated by a JavaScript client-side application that generates
            HTML on the fly.
            ❑ In the simplest case, it can be stored in a file and served to the browser by a
            Web server.

    <section id="Section5">
        <h2>HTML Page Structure</h2>
        <p>
            ❑ The HTML starting tag is used at the beginning of the document,
    right after the document type declaration.
            ❑ The HTML ending tag is the last thing present in an HTML
    document.
            ❑ Inside the HTML element we have 2 elements: head and body:
            ❑ Inside the head, we will have tags that are essential to creating a
    web page, like the title, the metadata, and internal or external
    CSS and JavaScript. Mostly things that do not directly appear on
    the page, but only help the browser (or bots like the Google
    search bot) display it properly.
            ❑ Inside the body we will have the content of the page. The visible
    stuff.

    <section id="Section6">
        <h2>Tags vs Elements</h2>
        <p>
            Elements have a starting tag and a closing tag. In this example, we use the p starting
and closing tags to create a p element:
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
So, an element constitutes the whole package:
❑ starting tag
❑ text content (and possibly other elements)
❑ closing tag
If an element has doesn't have a closing tag, it is only written with the starting tag, and it
cannot contain any text content.

    <section id="Section7">
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
            The starting tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach,
called attributes. Attributes have the key="value" syntax:
<p class="a-class">A paragraph of text</p>
The class and id attributes are two of the most common you will find used.
They have a special meaning, and they are useful both in CSS and JavaScript.
The difference between the two is that an id is unique in the context of a web page; it
cannot be duplicated. Classes, on the other hand, can appear multiple times on multiple
elements.
Plus, an id is just one value. A class can hold multiple values, separated by a space.
<p class="a-class another-class">A paragraph of text
        </p>

    <section id="Section8">
        <h2>Case Sensitive</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is case insensitive. Tags can be written in all caps, or lowercase. In the
early days, caps were the norm. Today lowercase is the norm. It is a
convention.
You usually write like this:
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
not like this:
<P>A paragraph of text
        </p>

    <section id="Section9">
        <h2>!DOCTYPE</h2>
        <p>❑ The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps
            browsers to
            ❑ display web pages correctly.
            ❑ It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
            ❑ The <!DoCtYpE> declaration is not case sensitive.
            ❑ The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is <!DOCTYPE html>

    <section id="Section12">
        <h2>Link</h2>
        <p>
            ❑ Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer.
❑ They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web
a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to
specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.
❑ Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise
activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL)

    <section id="Section13">
        <h2>Image</h2>
        <p>
            ❑ Images on a web page are created with the <img> tag.
❑ This tag can add images, icons, photos, and other graphic
elements.
❑ The <img> tag does not have a closing tag -- it is self-closing
